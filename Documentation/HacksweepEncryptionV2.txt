HACKSWEEP ENCRYPTION EXAMPLE 1
    Encryption: 0x00
    To Encrypt: This is a test message that will be sent in encryption of 0x00.
    Final: This is a test message that will be sent in encryption of 0x00. <- Transferred on BASIS of Letter Change as listed above


HACKSWEEP ENCRYPTION EXAMPLE 2
    Encryption: 3x15
